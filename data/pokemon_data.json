is a plant seed on its back right from the day this Pok\u00e9mon is born. The seed slowly grows larger.","1":"When the bulb on its back grows large, it appears to lose the ability to stand on its hind legs.","2":"Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight.","3":"It has a barbaric nature. In battle, it whips its fiery tail around and slashes away with sharp claws.","4":"It spits fire that is hot enough to melt boulders. It may cause forest fires by blowing flames.","5":"When it retracts its long neck into its shell, it squirts out water with vigorous force.","6":"For protection, it releases a horrible stench from the antenna on its head to drive away enemies.","7":"It is waiting for the moment to evolve. At this stage, it can only harden, so it remains motionless to avoid attack.","8":"In battle, it flaps its wings at great speed to release highly toxic dust into the air.","9":"Able to move only slightly. When endangered, it may stick out its stinger and poison its enemy.","10":"It has three poisonous stingers on its forelegs and its tail. They are used to jab its enemy repeatedly.","11":"Very docile. If attacked, it will often kick up sand to protect itself rather than fight back.","12":"This Pok\u00e9mon is full of vitality. It constantly flies around its large territory in search of prey.","13":"This Pok\u00e9mon flies at Mach 2 speed, seeking prey. Its large talons are feared as wicked weapons.","14":"Will chew on anything with its fangs. If you see one, you can be certain that 40 more live in the area.","15":"Inept at flying high. However, it can fly around very fast to protect its territory.","16":"A Pok\u00e9mon that dates back many years. If it senses danger, it flies high and away, instantly.","17":"The older it gets, the longer it grows. At night, it wraps its long body around tree branches to rest.","18":"Pikachu that can generate powerful electricity have cheek sacs that are extra soft and super stretchy.","19":"It loves to bathe in the grit of dry, sandy areas. By sand bathing, the Pok\u00e9mon rids itself of dirt and moisture clinging to its body.","20":"Females are more sensitive to smells than males. While foraging, they\u2019ll use their whiskers to check wind direction and stay downwind of predators.","21":"The horn on its head has atrophied. It\u2019s thought that this happens so Nidorina\u2019s children won\u2019t get poked while their mother is feeding them.","22":"Nidoqueen is better at defense than offense. With scales like armor, this Pok\u00e9mon will shield its children from any kind of attack.","23":"The horn on a male Nidoran\u2019s forehead contains a powerful poison. This is a very cautious Pok\u00e9mon, always straining its large ears.","24":"With a horn that\u2019s harder than diamond, this Pok\u00e9mon goes around shattering boulders as it searches for a moon stone.","25":"It is said that happiness will come to those who see a gathering of Clefairy dancing under a full moon.","26":"While young, it has six gorgeous tails. When it grows, several new tails are sprouted.","27":"Jigglypuff has top-notch lung capacity, even by comparison to other Pok\u00e9mon. It won\u2019t stop singing its lullabies until its foes fall asleep.","28":"It emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check its surroundings. Even in tight caves, Zubat flies around with skill.","29":"It loves to drink other creatures\u2019 blood. It\u2019s said that if it finds others of its kind going hungry, it sometimes shares the blood it\u2019s gathered.","30":"If exposed to moonlight, it starts to move. It roams far and wide at night to scatter its seeds.","31":"Its pistils exude an incredibly foul odor. The horrid stench can cause fainting at a distance of 1.25 miles.","32":"It has the world\u2019s largest petals. With every step, the petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen.","33":"Burrows under the ground to gnaw on tree roots. The mushrooms on its back absorb most of the nutrition.","34":"The bug host is drained of energy by the mushroom on its back. The mushroom appears to do all the thinking.","35":"Its large eyes act as radar. In a bright place, you can see that they are clusters of many tiny eyes.","36":"The powdery scales on its wings are hard to remove from skin. They also contain poison that leaks out on contact.","37":"A team of Diglett triplets. It triggers huge earthquakes by burrowing 60 miles underground.","38":"Getting this prideful Pok\u00e9mon to warm up to you takes a lot of effort, and it will claw at you the moment it gets annoyed.","39":"Psyduck is constantly beset by headaches. If the Pok\u00e9mon lets its strange power erupt, apparently the pain subsides for a while.","40":"This Pok\u00e9mon lives in gently flowing rivers. It paddles through the water with its long limbs, putting its graceful swimming skills on display.","41":"An agile Pok\u00e9mon that lives in trees. It angers easily and will not hesitate to attack anything.","42":"It stops being angry only when nobody else is around. To view this moment is very difficult.","43":"It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It fearlessly stands up to bigger and stronger foes.","44":"The sight of it running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night has captivated many people.","45":"For Poliwag, swimming is easier than walking. The swirl pattern on its belly is actually part of the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s innards showing through the skin.","46":"Staring at the swirl on its belly causes drowsiness. This trait of Poliwhirl\u2019s has been used in place of lullabies to get children to go to sleep.","47":"Its body is solid muscle. When swimming through cold seas, Poliwrath uses its impressive arms to smash through drift ice and plow forward.","48":"This Pok\u00e9mon uses its psychic powers while it sleeps. The contents of Abra\u2019s dreams affect the powers that the Pok\u00e9mon wields.","49":"Using its psychic power, Kadabra levitates as it sleeps. It uses its springy tail as a pillow.","50":"Its whole body is composed of muscles. Even though it\u2019s the size of a human child, it can hurl 100 grown-ups.","51":"It quickly swings its four arms to rock its opponents with ceaseless punches and chops from all angles.","52":"Lures prey with the sweet aroma of honey.

The Pok\u00e9mon is about to fire off a burst of ultrasonic waves.","54":"Commonly found near mountain trails and the like. If you step on one by accident, it gets angry.","55":"Often seen rolling down mountain trails. Obstacles are just things to roll straight over, not avoid.","56":"Once it sheds its skin, its body turns tender and whitish. Its hide hardens when it\u2019s exposed to air.","57":"It can\u2019t run properly when it\u2019s newly born. As it races around with others of its kind, its legs grow stronger.","58":"This Pok\u00e9mon can be seen galloping through fields at speeds of up to 150 mph, its fiery mane fluttering in the wind.","59":"Slow-witted and oblivious, this Pok\u00e9mon won\u2019t feel any pain if its tail gets eaten. It won\u2019t notice when its tail grows back, either.","60":"Slowpoke became Slowbro when a Shellder bit on to its tail. Sweet flavors seeping from the tail make the Shellder feel as if its life is a dream.","61":"At times, Magnemite runs out of electricity and ends up on the ground. If you give batteries to a grounded Magnemite, it\u2019ll start moving again.","62":"This Pok\u00e9mon is three Magnemite that have linked together. Magneton sends out powerful radio waves to study its surroundings.","63":"The stalk this Pok\u00e9mon carries in its wings serves as a sword to cut down opponents. In a dire situation, the stalk can also serve as food.","64":"Its short wings make flying difficult. Instead, this Pok\u00e9mon runs at high speed on developed legs.","65":"Loves freezing-cold conditions.

Each one appears to be made up of many life-forms stacked one on top of each other.","695":"It slithers toward people. Then, without warning, it triggers the explosion of its own head. It\u2019s apparently one kind of Ultra Beast.","696":"It electrifies its claws and tears its opponents apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack, they\u2019ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks.","697":"It melts particles of iron and other metals found in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its body of molten steel.","698":"At the end of its life-span, Melmetal will rust and fall apart. The small shards left behind will eventually be reborn as Meltan.","699":"When it uses its special stick to strike up a beat, the sound waves produced carry revitalizing energy to the plants and flowers in the area.","700":"The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from its peers.","701":"By drumming, it taps into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its direction in battle.","702":"A warm-up of running around gets fire energy coursing through this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body. Once that happens, it\u2019s ready to fight at full power.","703":"Its thick and fluffy fur protects it from the cold and enables it to use hotter fire moves.","704":"It juggles a pebble with its feet, turning it into a burning soccer ball. Its shots strike opponents hard and leave them scorched.","705":"When scared, this Pok\u00e9mon cries. Its tears pack the chemical punch of 100 onions, and attackers won\u2019t be able to resist weeping.","706":"A clever combatant, this Pok\u00e9mon battles using water balloons created with moisture secreted from its palms.","707":"It has many hidden capabilities, such as fingertips that can shoot water and a membrane on its back that it can use to glide through the air.","708":"Found throughout the Galar region, this Pok\u00e9mon becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely empty of berries.","709":"It stashes berries in its tail\u2014so many berries that they fall out constantly. But this Pok\u00e9mon is a bit slow-witted, so it doesn\u2019t notice the loss.","710":"A constant collector of information, this Pok\u00e9mon is very smart. Very strong is what it isn\u2019t.","711":"It secretly marks potential targets with a scent. By following the scent, it stalks its targets and steals from them when they least expect it.","712":"It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg, then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly.","713":"The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that plants and other Pok\u00e9mon can benefit from them.","714":"Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pok\u00e9mon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.","715":"Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You\u2019ll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it.","716":"Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it.","717":"With jaws that can shear through steel rods, this highly aggressive Pok\u00e9mon chomps down on its unfortunate prey.","718":"Most of its body has the same composition as coal. Fittingly, this Pok\u00e9mon was first discovered in coal mines about 400 years ago.","719":"It\u2019s usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.","720":"It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns.","721":"Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pok\u00e9mon it preys on.","722":"As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than 17 pounds of sand.","723":"When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.","724":"It\u2019s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it\u2019s battling midfight.","725":"If it sees any movement around it, this Pok\u00e9mon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It\u2019s very proud of that jaw.","726":"This Pok\u00e9mon has a jaw that\u2019s as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda\u2019s flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.","727":"It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pok\u00e9mon, a tingling sensation follows.","728":"Capable of generating 15,000 volts of electricity, this Pok\u00e9mon looks down on all that would challenge it.","729":"It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot.","730":"When it heats up, its body temperature reaches about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its body like a whip and launches itself at enemies.","731":"It\u2019s very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.","732":"A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pok\u00e9mon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful.","733":"This Pok\u00e9mon is said to have been born when a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup of tea.","734":"This species lives in antique teapots. Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions, an authentic work is found.","735":"Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures\u2019 emotions. If you don\u2019t have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you.","736":"No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pok\u00e9mon, it will silence you violently.","737":"It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others.","738":"Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations produced by people and Pok\u00e9mon when they feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy.","739":"When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for forgiveness, it\u2019s trying to lure opponents in so that it can stab them with its spear-like hair.","740":"With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pok\u00e9mon can overwhelm even Machamp.","741":"Only Farfetch\u2019d that have survived many battles can attain this evolution. When this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s leek withers, it will retire from combat.","742":"It\u2019s highly skilled at tap-dancing. It waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.","743":"A powerful curse was woven into an ancient painting. After absorbing the spirit of a Yamask, the painting began to move.","744":"When it trusts a Trainer, it will treat them to berries it's decorated with cream.","745":"It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps.","746":"It stands in grasslands, watching the sun\u2019s descent from zenith to horizon. This Pok\u00e9mon has a talent for delivering dynamic kicks.","747":"It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold.","748":"It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need.","749":"As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pok\u00e9mon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It\u2019s also generating electricity.","750":"It digs up the ground with its trunk. It\u2019s also very strong, being able to carry loads of over five tons without any problem at all.","751":"They came over from another region long ago and worked together with humans. Their green skin is resistant to water.","752":"In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources.","753":"The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.","754":"Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.","755":"Though it\u2019s able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head.","756":"Its body resembles polished metal, and it\u2019s both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.","757":"After being reborn as a ghost Pok\u00e9mon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas.","758":"It\u2019s capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve.","759":"When it isn\u2019t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles.","760":"Known as a legendary hero, this Pok\u00e9mon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.","761":"In times past, it worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs metal that it then uses in battle.","762":"The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay
